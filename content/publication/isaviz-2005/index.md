abstract = "In this work we developed an extension of IsaViz software, a RDF (Resource Description Framework) authoring tool, designed to be a graphical environment to build models of metabolic and regulatory networks. This environment, called Metabolic IsaViz, was linked to a genomic library of types and was modeled on the basis of ontologies. Biochemical pathways included data at sequence level (e.g., the amino acid sequence of enzymes), besides kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the reactions. Models created with Metabolic IsaViz could be exported to pathways simulators through SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language), which allowed to analyze the pathway dynamics of target chemicals."
