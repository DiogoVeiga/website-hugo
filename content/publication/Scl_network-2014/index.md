abstract = "Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) represent a rare sub-population that often escape therapy. To elucidate the molecular network controlling LSC self-renewal, we developed a novel computational approach that explores the commonalities between normal and LSCs to find transcription factors (TFs) and targets implicated in the acquisition of self-renewal in immature thymocytes. The method constructs a self-renewal regulatory network by searching for stem cell TFs that are transcriptionally activated by oncogenes in immature thymocytes, and then connects these regulators to their downstream targets using ChIP-seq data. Activated stem cell TFs are selected on the basis of two criteria: (i) up-regulation in normal stem cell signatures, as determinedby overlap with published stem cell signatures, and (ii) TF-bound genes are up-regulated in progenitor thymocytes with aberrant self-renewal capacity, as determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We used this approach to characterize the self-renewal network activated in DN3 thymocytes due to oncogenic reprogramming by SCL-LMO1. The analysis predicted a hierarchical network in which Lyl1 is a major regulator downstream of SCL-LMO1, and revealed that Scl, Lmo1 and Lyl1 redundantly co-regulate a self-renewal program in DN3 thymocytes. We confirmed by ChIP and reporter assays that SCL-LMO1 binds to Lyl1 promoter, leading to transcriptional activation. Functionally, we show by transplantation assays that LYL1 mimic the effects of SCL to collaborate with LMO1 and induce DN3 thymocyte self-renewal. Additionally, we found by RNA-seq that the SCL-LMO1 self-renewal network is predominantly activated in the early stages of the disease, and is diluted in the bulk of leukemic cells in late stage thymomas, which are marked by an activation of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic genes. Together, these results indicate that the acquisition of self-renewal represents an initiating event in leukemogenesis while disease progression is associated with additional fitness traits such as cell proliferation and survival. Our observations have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting LSCs self-renewal in T-ALL."
