# About me

I am currently a Full Computational Scientist at the Jackson Laboratory. I joined [Jacques Banchereau's lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-banchereau-lab) at the Jackson Laboratory to help developing a groundbreaking research program aimed at the identification of cancer isoforms using hybrid-capture long-read sequencing. Here, I am leading the development of a computational pipeline to analyze hybrid-capture long-read sequencing data combined with RNA-seq data to discover RNA-based neoantigens. Our premise is that splicing aberration in cancer generates RNA-based neoantigens that can be exploited for immunotherapy.  

I have extensive expertise in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data sets, including WGS, Exome-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and Pacbio long read SMRT-seq. 

I have a passion for analyzing big data, in particular in the field of genomics, using R and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).
